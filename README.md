## Current Stage and Call for Contributors

Our antivirus platform is still in its **early stages of development**, and we are actively looking for **contributors** to join our team. Whether you are a professional developer, a cybersecurity enthusiast, or someone eager to test and improve cutting-edge technologies, we need your help to bring this vision to life.

Together, weâ€™ll create a platform that pushes the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in the antivirus industry.

## Our Core Principles

To ensure we build a strong, efficient, and innovative platform, we are guided by the following principles:

### 1. Cross-Platform Compatibility
Our platform is designed with **cross-platform functionality** in mind. In the future, it must build and run seamlessly across multiple operating systems. This is a core requirement for our development efforts.

### 2. Security
Security is at the heart of everything we do. All code must adhere to strict **security standards and best practices** to ensure the platform is robust against attacks and vulnerabilities.

### 3. Performance
**Speed is critical** in the modern antivirus industry. Every function and method should prioritize performance. If an algorithm can be optimized for speed, it must be done. High performance isnâ€™t just a goalâ€”itâ€™s a necessity.

### 4. Minimalism
We strongly advocate for **minimalism** in design and implementation. Avoid creating unnecessary complexities. If one well-designed entity can replace many, it should. Simplicity is the key to both maintainability and efficiency.

# Antivirus Library

## Overview
The Antivirus Library is a high-performance, modular, and comprehensive solution designed to provide cutting-edge protection against modern threats. This library integrates multiple layers of security techniques to ensure robust defense and rapid detection capabilities for diverse environments.

## Features

1. **Hash Scanning**
   - Utilizes cryptographic hash functions (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) for rapid identification of known malware samples.
   - Ensures minimal computational overhead with efficient file scanning.

2. **Signature-Based Scanning**
   - Employs a database of malware signatures to detect known threats.
   - Supports dynamic signature updates for real-time protection.

3. **Heuristic Analysis**
   - Detects unknown threats by analyzing patterns, behaviors, and code structures.
   - Reduces dependency on predefined signatures.

4. **Behavioral Scanning**
   - Monitors the runtime behavior of applications to identify malicious activities.
   - Blocks zero-day threats and unknown malware based on suspicious actions.

5. **Emulation Engine**
   - Executes suspicious files in a secure virtual environment to observe their behavior.
   - Provides accurate detection without compromising the host system.

6. **Anti-Cryptolocker**
   - Protects against ransomware by monitoring and blocking unauthorized encryption activities.
   - Automatically quarantines malicious processes before damage occurs.

7. **Shadow Copy Restoration**
   - Automatically creates shadow copies of critical files for recovery in case of malware attacks.
   - Ensures minimal data loss in case of an incident.

8. **Insider Protection**
   - Detects and mitigates threats originating from within the organization.
   - Monitors user actions and access levels to prevent unauthorized activities.

9. **Identity Protection**
   - Safeguards sensitive user credentials and personal information.
   - Provides alerts for potential identity theft and unauthorized data access.
